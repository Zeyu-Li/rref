# rref matrix calculator in C++ (via Gauss Jordan method)

## About

This project is a rref calculator. Modify the matrices and
this program will calculate the rref if there exist a rref

The main_hard cpp file require you to hard code the 
numbers in matrices into the int structures a and b

On the other hand, the main is a console application that can be run

Also, if illegal rrefs (ie not constant [example: 0x = 2]), 
then an error will be printed

Similarly, there will also be an error printed if the matrix
is given anything other than fractions and integers 
(floats or decimals will not be accepted)

Also included is a main.h file that does nothing
