# rref matrix calculator in C++ (via Gauss Jordan method)

## About

This project is a rref calculator. Modify the matrices and
this program will calculate the rref if there exist a rref

The main_hard cpp file require you to hard code the 
numbers in matrices into the int structures a and b

On the other hand, the main is a console application that can be run

Also, no illegal rrefs (ie not constant [example: 0x = 2])

Also included is a main.h file that does nothing
